# Zonga E-commerce Shop
can log in with either their Google or Facebook accounts. Logged in users will be able to add items to the basket, remove items from the basket, and checkout. After shopping, the user can proceed to checkout. Payment is processed using Stripe - an online payment processing company. Users will be notified after their others have been processed successfully. They can view the order list before logging out. The products are stored in the MongoDB atlas database online. The app fetches the products stored in the database on the initial page load and displays them on the home page. 

This app is built with Next.js and React.js. There is an admin page that only appears when a user logs in with the store admin email address. Through the admin page, the user can add, view, delete, edit items in the store database. 

NB: The pictures are free pictures selected from the internet and stored in the picture storing site [Imgur](https://imgur.com/). The picture links are now used as a string in this project. I have a plan of adding more features to this app in the future.
